# draw2intel
Simple html/javascipt page to convert IITC drawstring to intel

If you haven't bothered to setup IITC, but people keep posting drawstrings but no intel links
for their grand field plans you need this if you don't want to be left out.

If you still have no idea what this is good for you won't need it ... :-P

To use it just download the file draw2string.html and open it with your browser. Copy and paste
the drawstring into the text box and press the button.
